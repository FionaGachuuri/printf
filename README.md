# The Printf function
This is a team project that requires us to create a custom printf function using the C programming Language. The function has to run like the one in the c standard library.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/xander254/printf.git
  cd printf
  ./a.out
```
    
## Lessons Learned

We Learned alot on how to collaborate on a project, time management, task prioritization, pair programming, low level programming concepts


## Appendix

This was a very great project that gave us an impression of how real problems can can be solved. We are very greatfull to ALX Africa for this challange:)
